### 👉 **[Click me](https://fiverr-clone-ncbgt1gqm-ayushjha-sys-projects.vercel.app)** 👈

Welcome to **FreelanceHub**, a modern freelance marketplace built using the MERN stack. This project allows freelancers to create gigs, showcase their skills, and receive payments securely through QR codes. Clients can explore services, view gig details, and connect with professionals easily.

This project represents my journey into full-stack development, where I combined frontend, backend, database, and deployment into one complete real-world application.
